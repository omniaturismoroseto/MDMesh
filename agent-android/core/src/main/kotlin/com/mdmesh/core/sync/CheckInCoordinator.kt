/**
 * One full check-in cycle — the source of truth of the sync loop:
 *
 *  1. ensure the device is enrolled (server-issued id);
 *  2. drain pending command acks and POST them together with the fresh capabilities;
 *  3. dispatch each returned (capability-gated) command;
 *  4. buffer the new results for delivery on the next cycle.
 *
 * [runOnce] is single-flight process-wide (singleton + mutex): the periodic worker, the one-shot
 * worker, the foreground service, the doze heartbeat and WebSocket wakes all race into it, and a
 * fresh device firing several concurrent enrolls burns its single-use token.
 *
 * Network/enroll failures bubble up so [CheckInWorker] applies WorkManager backoff; any
 * drained acks are restored to the buffer so they retry. Per-command failures never abort
 * the batch — they become `failed`/`unsupported`/`expired` results.
